            <h2>Espresso</h2>
            <p>
              An espresso is a strong, concentrated coffee made by forcing hot
              water through finely-ground coffee beans under high pressure. It
              is the foundation of many popular drinks such as cappuccino,
              latte, and mocha. The drink contains no milk or sugar by default
              and is served in small portions called shots. Espresso has a bold,
              rich, and slightly bitter flavor, topped with a golden layer of
              crema. Although small in volume, it carries a powerful caffeine
              kick. The method originated in Italy in the early 1900s and was
              designed for quick preparation and intense flavor. Today, the term
              “espresso” refers both to the brewing method and the small,
              flavorful shot it produces.

          <article id="cappuccino" class="coffee-card">
            <h2>Cappuccino</h2>
            <p>
              A cappuccino is an espresso-based drink made with equal parts
              espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. It has a rich, balanced
              flavor—stronger than a latte but smoother than a plain
              espresso—enhanced by its thick, velvety froth. Many cafés top it
              with cocoa powder or cinnamon for added aroma and taste.
              Variations include “dry” cappuccinos with more foam and “wet” ones
              with more milk. With one or two espresso shots, it delivers a
              satisfying caffeine boost. The drink originated in Italy and takes
              its name from the Capuchin monks, whose brown robes resemble the
              color of the beverage. Today, the cappuccino remains a classic
              morning favorite around the world.

          <article id="latte" class="coffee-card">
            <h2>Latte</h2>
            <p>
              A latte, short for caffè latte meaning “milk coffee” in Italian,
              is an espresso-based drink made with steamed milk and a small
              layer of foam. It is known for its smooth, creamy texture and mild
              flavor, as the milk softens the espresso’s strength. Lattes are
              often flavored with syrups such as vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut,
              and can be served hot or iced. They contain one or two shots of
              espresso, giving them a moderate caffeine level. Originating from
              Italy, the modern café-style latte became especially popular in
              the U.S. and Europe during the 1980s. Today, it is often decorated
              with latte art and enjoyed for its comforting, velvety taste.

            <h2>Americano</h2>
            <p>
              An Americano is a simple yet flavorful coffee made by diluting
              espresso with hot water. The result is a drink similar in strength
              to drip coffee but with a smoother, richer taste. It offers the
              depth of espresso without its intense concentration. Americanos
              can be served hot or iced, and their strength can be adjusted by
              varying the espresso-to-water ratio. The drink traces its origins
              to World War II, when American soldiers in Italy diluted espresso
              to make it resemble the coffee they were used to back home. Today,
              the Americano is enjoyed globally for its mild yet full-bodied
              character and its moderate-to-high caffeine content.

          <article id="mocha" class="coffee-card">
            <h2>Mocha</h2>
            <p>
              A mocha is an espresso-based coffee drink that combines the
              richness of coffee with the sweetness of chocolate. Made with
              espresso, steamed milk, and a chocolate source such as syrup,
              cocoa powder, or chocolate sauce, it delivers a perfect balance of
              deep coffee flavor and creamy sweetness. Mochas can be served hot
              or cold and are often topped with whipped cream, making them a
              favorite dessert-like beverage for coffee lovers. Because they are
              made with espresso, mochas naturally contain caffeine. The name
              “mocha” originally referred to a type of coffee bean from the port
              city of Mocha in Yemen, known for its naturally chocolatey flavor.
              Over time, the term evolved, and today it commonly refers to any
              chocolate-flavored coffee drink rather than the original bean
              variety.

          <article id="cold-brew" class="coffee-card">
            <h2>Cold Brew</h2>
            <p>
              Cold brew is a refreshing coffee made by steeping coarse-ground
              beans in cold water for 12 to 24 hours, creating a smooth, less
              acidic coffee concentrate served chilled. Unlike traditional iced
              coffee, which is brewed hot and then cooled, cold brew never
              touches heat, resulting in a naturally sweeter and less bitter
              flavor. It can be served over ice, with milk or cream, or mixed
              with flavored syrups. Because of its long brewing process, cold
              brew tends to be higher in caffeine than regular coffee. Although
              cold brewing dates back to 17th-century Japan with the Kyoto-style
              method, it has recently gained popularity worldwide as a cool,
              energizing drink perfect for warm days.
