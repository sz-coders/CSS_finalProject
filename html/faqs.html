    <section id="faqs-coffee&beans" class="faqs">
      <h2>Coffee & Beans</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Is espresso stronger than drip coffee?</summary>
        <p>
          Per ounce, espresso is more concentrated; per typical serving the
          total caffeine may be similar or lower depending on serving sizes.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How should I store coffee beans?</summary>
        <p>
          Keep beans in an airtight container, away from light, heat, and
          moisture. Grind just before brewing for best freshness.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Does coffee dehydrate?</summary>
        <p>
          Moderate coffee intake does not cause net dehydration for most people;
          it contributes to daily fluid intake.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Which has more caffeine — dark or light roast?</summary>
        <p>
          By weight light roast has slightly more caffeine, but by volume
          (scoops) the difference is small and usually irrelevant to most
          drinkers.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is single-origin coffee?</summary>
        <p>
          Single-origin coffee comes from one specific region, farm, or
          producer, highlighting unique flavors tied to that location’s terroir.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>
          What’s the difference between cold brew and iced coffee?
        </summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Cold brew</strong> is made by steeping coffee grounds in cold
          water for 12–24 hours, producing a smooth, low-acid drink.<br /><strong
            >Iced coffee</strong
          >
          is regular brewed coffee cooled and poured over ice, giving a
          brighter, more acidic taste.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>
          What’s the difference between espresso and regular coffee?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Espresso is brewed under high pressure using finely ground coffee,
          producing a small, concentrated shot with crema on top. Regular drip
          or filter coffee uses gravity and a coarser grind, resulting in a
          larger, milder cup.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Does roast level affect caffeine content?</summary>
        <p>
          Not much. Light and dark roasts have almost the same caffeine per
          bean. Light roasts may have *slightly* more by weight because they’re
          denser, but the difference is minor.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How can I choose the right coffee for me?</summary>
        <p>
          Try different combinations! Start with your preference for flavor
          (light vs bold), milk (black vs creamy), and caffeine strength. Light
          roast Arabica for mild flavor, dark roast Robusta blends for intense
          kick.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Which coffee bean is stronger — Arabica, Robusta, or Liberica?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Each coffee species has its own distinct flavor and caffeine profile,
          so in terms of caffeine strength,
          <strong>Robusta</strong> is the strongest, but
          <strong>Liberica</strong> offers the most distinctive flavor profile.

      <h2>Brewing</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>What is the best brewing method for beginners?</summary>
        <p>
          The <strong>French Press</strong> is great for beginners — it’s
          simple, requires no special equipment, and gives a rich, full-bodied
          flavor. You only need coarsely ground coffee, hot water, and 4–5
          minutes of steeping time.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>
          What is the ideal water temperature for brewing coffee?
        </summary>
        <p>
          About 90–96°C (195–205°F) is a common recommendation for most methods.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why does my coffee taste bitter?</summary>
        <p>
          The ideal brewing temperature is between
          <strong>90°C and 96°C (195°F–205°F)</strong>. Boiling water can scorch
          coffee grounds, while cooler water may under-extract them.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What is grinding?</summary>
        <p>
          Grinding is breaking coffee beans into smaller particles to increase
          surface area for extraction.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How important is grind uniformity?</summary>
        <p>
          Very — inconsistent grind yields under- and over-extracted flavors.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can I learn brewing visually?</summary>
        <p>
          Absolutely! Watch our short brewing demonstrations in the
          <a href="#demo-video">video section</a> or explore
